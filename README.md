# Attention Insight UI Test


## Instructions
We'd like for you to create simple SPA that will allow users to see a list of their studies and navigate to them to see a detailed view.

## Objectives
  * Needs to have a way to display all the studies
    * Must be filterable
    * Must have a way to search them
  * Needs to have a way to display each study details

### Bonus points
  * Image gallery for study details
  * Tests

## General tips
  * API mocks are provided in the public folder
  * Feel free to pick any library you wish
  * Examine the API responses closely to determine what you can show
  * There's no UI guideline, but since you are a frontender we expect you to have certain level of detail
  * Do get in touch with us if you have any questions

## Deliverables
  * We expect you to submit to us a .zip file (without the `node_modules` folder, but with the .git folder) or access to a private github repo so we can inspect the code.
  * Tests are nice to have, but not mandatory
